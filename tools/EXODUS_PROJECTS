These are the projects within vanir's github containing exodus branches.  All should
be included in vanir's gerrit.  To contribute push to refs/for/EXODUS.
If you're interested in contributing to a project not listed here and would
not like to submit to vanir's basic L5 branch for review send an email or
contact PrimeDirective on hangouts @ ActiveThrasher00@gmail.com and I'll add
the projects you need.
